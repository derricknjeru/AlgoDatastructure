    /**
     * There is a new alien language which uses the latin alphabet.
     *  However, the order among letters are unknown to you.
     *
     *  You receive a list of words from the dictionary, where words are sorted lexicographically
     *  by the rules of this new language.
     *
     *  Derive the order of letters in this language.
     *
     *  For example,
     *
     *  Given the following words in dictionary,
     *    [
     *      "wrt",
     *      "wrf",
     *      "er",
     *      "ett",
     *      "rftt"
     *    ]
     *
     *  The correct order is: "wertf".
     *
     *
     *  Input:
     *  [
     *  "z",
     *  "x",
     *  "z"
     *  ]
     *
     *  Output: ""
     *
     *  Explanation: The order is invalid, so return "".
     *
     *
     *  Note.md.md.md.md:
     *      You may assume all letters are in lowercase.
     *      If the order is invalid, return an empty string.
     *      There may be multiple valid order of letters, return any one of them is fine.

    /**
     * Certainly! Building the graph involves analyzing the relationships between characters in the given words to determine the order of letters in the alien language. Here's how it works:
     * <p>
     * Initialize an empty graph represented by a Map<Character, Set<Character>>. This map will store the characters as keys and their corresponding neighbors as values.
     * <p>
     * Iterate through the given words, comparing adjacent words pair by pair.
     * <p>
     * For each pair of adjacent words, find the first characters that differ. This indicates an ordering relationship between the characters.
     * <p>
     * Add an edge from the differing character in the first word to the differing character in the second word.
     * <p>
     * If the differing character in the first word is not already a key in the graph, add it with an empty set as its value.
     * <p>
     * Add the differing character in the second word to the set of neighbors of the differing character in the first word.
     * <p>
     * Repeat steps 3-6 for all pairs of adjacent words.
     * <p>
     * By the end of this process, the graph will represent the relationships between the characters in the alien language. Each character will be a key in the map, and its corresponding value will be a set containing all the characters that come after it in the language.
     * <p>
     * For example, let's consider the input words: ["wrt", "wrf", "er", "ett", "rftt"].
     * <p>
     * Comparing "wrt" and "wrf", we find that 't' comes before 'f'. So we add an edge from 't' to 'f' in the graph.
     * Comparing "wrf" and "er", we find that 'w' comes before 'e'. So we add an edge from 'w' to 'e' in the graph.
     * Comparing "er" and "ett", we find that 'r' comes before 't'. So we add an edge from 'r' to 't' in the graph.
     * Comparing "ett" and "rftt", we find that 'e' comes before 'r'. So we add an edge from 'e' to 'r' in the graph.
     * The resulting graph will look like this:
     * <p>
     * arduino
     * Copy code
     * {
     * 'w': ['e'],
     * 'r': ['t'],
     * 'e': ['r'],
     * 't': ['f']
     * }
     * This graph represents the relationships between the characters 'w', 'r', 'e', 't', and 'f' in the alien language. In this case, the order of letters can be derived as "wertf".
     * <p>
     * The subsequent topological sorting step performs a depth-first search (DFS) on the graph to determine the order of letters based on the edges.
