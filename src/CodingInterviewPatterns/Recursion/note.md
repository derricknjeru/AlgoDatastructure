# Recursion

 Recursion is an approach to solving problems using a function that calls itself as a subroutine.
 ```

- The trick is that each time a recursive function calls itself, it reduces the given problem into subproblems
  
A recursive function should have the following properties so that it does not result in an infinite loop:
1. A simple base case (or cases) — a terminating scenario that does not use recursion to produce an answer.
2. A set of rules, also known as recurrence relation that reduces all other cases towards the base case.
