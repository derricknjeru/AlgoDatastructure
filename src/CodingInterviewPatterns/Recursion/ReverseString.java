    /**
     * The time complexity of the reverseString function, as well as the reverseStringHelper recursive function, is O(n),
     * where n is the length of the input string.
     *
     * The recursion makes n/2 recursive calls, as each recursive call reduces the size of the problem by 2 characters.
     * In each recursive call, a constant amount of work is performed, including the swapping of characters at the left and right indices.
     * Therefore, the overall time complexity is linear, proportional to the length of the input string.
     *
     * The space complexity of the recursion is O(n) as well.
     * Each recursive call adds a new frame to the call stack, which requires space to store the local variables and parameters of that call. Since there can be at most n/2 recursive calls in this case,
     * the space complexity is linear with respect to the length of the input string.
     *
     * It's important to README.md.md that the space complexity of the algorithm is considered O(1) in terms of extra memory,
     * as it doesn't use any additional data structures proportional to the input size. Instead,
     * it modifies the input array in-place.
