# Connected vs Strongly connected component

#### Connected components are found in undirected graph and SCC are found in the directed graphs

For undirected graphs there is the notion of connected components, which you find by performing a DFS on the undirected graph.

For directed graphs there is the notion of strongly connected components, for which multiple algorithms are available, all slightly more complicated than a simple DFS.
