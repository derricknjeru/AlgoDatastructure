Given an integer array nums and two integers left and right, return the number of contiguous non-empty subarray.
such that the value of the maximum array element in that number is in the range [left,right]

Example:
Input:nums [2, 1, 4, 3] left = 2, right = 3
output 3

There are 3 subarrays that meet the requirement [2] [2,1] [3]
